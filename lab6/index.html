			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Using js arrays and objects, and having them show on a website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a problem having the scripts from the js file show up on the website. I solved it by
						having adding the variables from lab 5's js file to lab 6's js file. I don't know how it worked,
						but it worked.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Besides the problem that arose, this lab was really straightforward. If that 
						problem didn't happen this lab could have taken me about 30 minutes, instead
						it took over 2 hours. I guess that is just what happens with coding.
					</p>
