// Author: Jonah Teitz
// Date: October 21, 2023


//With some addition from Bard


// Create a grid and walls
// Place the snake and the apple on the grid
// Set the initial snake direction

// Main game loop

// Print the grid and walls

// Draw the snake, differentiating between the head and tail

// Accept user input and validate it
    //Have snake move in user direction

// Test if the snake ate the apple
    // If so, delete the apple, place a new apple on the grid, and add a pixel to the end of the snake
    // Otherwise, keep the apple in the same spot and do not increase the snake length

// Test for lose condition
    // If the snake head hits its own body or a wall, the game is lost

// Test for win condition
    // If the entire grid is filled, the game is won

// If the game is not over, continue the loop
