					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a function that sorts a given name.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems creating the javascript code, by I solved it pretty easily by testing and debugging.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a fun assignment. I was able to create a lab structure easily by copying lab 1's folder.
						 I started writing the code on the notes app on my phone while waiting for another class of mine to start.
						That created some debugging I had to do, but other than that this lab went smoothly.
						
						I don't have time to do Task X right now, so I will do it later, probably next week.
					</p>
