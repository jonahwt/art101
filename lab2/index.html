		<p>I'm Jonah, and my partner is Camille. We are both Film and Digital media majors. We are in this class because we both wanted to learn code. My favorite movie is <span>The Good,
			The Bad, and the Ugly</span>. Camille's is <span>La La Land</span>. Camille is very nice, even when I mistakes or when she does more work than me.

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Learning and using HTML and CSS.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The Lab2 website was using the CSS for the main website. We solved it by deleting the code that linked
						to the site CSS.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Since this was our first time playing with CSS, we just had a lot of fun with it. We didn't try to make it look that good,
						we were just going crazy with it. In our next lab, we will try to make the lab look better.</p>
